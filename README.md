PokeGC-TIDTool (preliminary name) is a suite of tools for manipulating your Trainer ID and Secret ID on the Nintendo Gamecube *Pokémon* game *Colosseum*.  *XD: Gale of Darkness* may also work with the same tools, but this receives no official support from the author (yet).
Support for *Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire* may be added at a later date.

Supported functionality includes generating a list of illegal TID/SID combinations and searching for seeds to abuse with.

This suite is best paired with the [TurboRNG](http://turborng.6te.net/) general-purpose RNG abuse program.
