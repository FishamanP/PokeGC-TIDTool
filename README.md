PokeGC-TIDTool (preliminary name) is a suite of tools for manipulating your Trainer ID and Secret ID on the Nintendo Gamecube *Pokémon* game *Colosseum*.  *XD: Gale of Darkness* may also work with the same tools, but this recieves no official support from the author (yet).
Support for *Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire* may be added at a later date.

Right now, the only functionality supported is generating a list of illegal TID/SID combinations.  In the near future, support for searching for seeds to abuse with will be added.

This suite is best paired with the [TurboRNG](http://turborng.6te.net/) general general RNG abuse program.
