PokeGC-TIDTool (preliminary name) is a suite of tools for manipulating your Trainer ID and Secret ID on the Nintendo Gamecube *Pokémon* game *Colosseum*.  *XD: Gale of Darkness* may also work with the same tools, but this receives no official support from the author (yet).

Supported functionality includes generating a list of illegal TID/SID combinations and searching for seeds to abuse with.

This tool is best paired with ginzaru's [xdseed](http://www.geocities.jp/ginzaru_xd/) Colosseum/XD RNG abuse suite.
